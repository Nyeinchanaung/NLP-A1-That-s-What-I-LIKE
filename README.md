- `models` folder which contains four model exports and their metadata files.
 
## How to run
 - Clone the repo
 - Open the project
 - Open the `app` folder
 - `streamlit run app.py`
 - app should be up and run on `http://localhost:8501/`

## Dataset

### Model Comparison and Analysis

| Model             | Window Size | Training Loss | Training Time | Semantic Accuracy | Syntactic Accuracy | Similarity (Correlation Score) |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Skipgram          | 2     | 9.32      | 10 min 18 sec       | 0.00%            | 0.00%           | 0.08   |
| Skipgram (NEG)    | 2     | 1.23       | 12 min 23 sec       | 0.00%            | 0.00%           | 0.14   |
| Glove             | 2     | 0.31      | 1 min 12 sec       | 0.00%            | 0.00%           | 0.02   |
| Glove (Gensim)    | - | -       | -       | 53%            | 55%           | 0.58   |

### Report
#### Observations
- Training Loss:<br />
Skipgram (Negative Sampling) achieved a significantly lower training loss (1.23) compared to Skipgram (9.32), showing improved learning efficiency with negative sampling.
GloVe had the lowest loss at 0.31.
<br />
- Training Time:<br />
Skipgram models took over 10 minutes, while GloVe training was the fastest at just over 1 minute.
<br />
- Semantic and Syntactic Accuracy:<br />
Only GloVe (Gensim) showed significant semantic and syntactic accuracy, with 53% and 55%, respectively.
Custom Skipgram and GloVe implementations reported 0% in both categories, indicating limitations in training or dataset coverage for these experiments.
<br />
- Similarity Correlation:<br />
GloVe (Gensim) had the highest similarity correlation (0.58) with human-labeled data, indicating the best performance in capturing word associations.
Skipgram (NEG) had a moderate score of 0.14, while Skipgram and GloVe scored poorly at 0.08 and 0.02, respectively.

##### Similarity test report

| Model             | Skipgram | NEG    |  GloVe   | GloVe (gensim)| Y true |
|-------------------|----------|---------|---------|---------------|--------|
| Spearman correlation | 0.08  | 0.14    | 0.0205  | 0.5800        |1       |
| MSE               | 31.6928  | 29.7797 | 32.2789 | 27.8081       |0       |

- Spearman Correlation: <br />
 Measures how well the predicted similarities align with human-judged similarities.
 <br />
- MSE (Mean Squared Error): <br />
Measures prediction error against human judgment.
